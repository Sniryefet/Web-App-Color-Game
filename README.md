# Color Game

Welcome to my first Web-App .


#### Game Overview
---
The user is presented with 3 , 6 , 9 (depends on the game difficulty) sqaures in variouses colors.
In the header the user can see the specific rgb color he needs to find among the squares.
once the user clicks on the square he thinks is the right one , if he is indeed correct all the squares will be colored in that same color and "Correct" message will apear .
Otherwise the chosen square will fade and "Try Again" message will apear.
